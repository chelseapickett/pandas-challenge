Two data sets of school and student information were analyzed to find observable trends with student's standardized test scores in relationship with school size, school type and school budget. The following categories were analyzed to reveal any such trends:
- District Summary
- School Summary
- Highest Performing Schools (by percentage of overall passing)
- Lowest Performing Schools (by percentage of overall passing)
- Math Scores by Grade
- Reading Scores by Grade
- Scores by School Spending
- Scores by School Size 
- Scores by School Type

Summary:

The data shows that students from small and medium sized charter schools (2,000 or less students) are much more likely to pass math than that of students who attend a large district school (93.5% vs 70% passing math). Reading test scores were also higher, but by a smaller margin (96.8% vs 82.8% passing reading). It seems that school type is one of the best indicators for test scores. Small and medium sized schools in this dataset were all charter schools so it may also be said that students at schools with less than 2,000 students are much more likely to receive higher standardized test scores, especially in math.

The school budget does not seem to positively impact the test scores of students, however the per student budget for district and charter schools was fairly similar with a range of $74 per student ($581-$655). It is also observed that all large district schools had a per student budget above $600 while the smaller charter schools had a larger variation in their per student budget. This implies that the school budget has very little or nothing to do with standardized test score outcomes. There does seem to be a correlation between the overall passing rate for students and the per student budget, however the highest per student budget category also has the smallest percentage of passing students.

Further analysis regarding class size and math teaching styles and strategies could provide a more clear correlation between charter schools and the standardized math test scores. It may also be helpful to examine the overall passing category of students to find a link between overall passing rates and larger district schools.
